    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish made with fermented vegetables. Its ingredients can vary, but napa cabbage and Korean radish are common bases. Kimchi also often includes green onions, ginger, and garlic. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 heads napa cabbage</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>5 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>½ small white onion, minced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean chili powder)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut cabbages in half lengthwise and trim the ends. Rinse and cut into pieces about 2 inch square. Place cabbage into large resealable bags; sprinkle salt evenly over leaves to coat. Use your hands to rub salt into cabbage. Seal the bags and leave at room temperature for 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Rinse cabbage leaves under cold water, at least 2 to 3 times, to remove most of the salt; drain and squeeze out any excess liquid.</li>
        <li>Place rinsed cabbage in a large container with a tight fitting lid. Stir in fish sauce, green onions, white onion, garlic, sugar, and ginger. Sprinkle Korean chile powder over mixture.; wear plastic gloves to protect your hands and rub chile powder into cabbage leaves until evenly coated.        </li>
        <li>Seal the container and set in a cool dry place. Leave undisturbed for 4 days. Refrigerate before serving, and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month (if it lasts that long!)..</li>
    </ol>
